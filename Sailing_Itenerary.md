## Itinerary
### Sunday 
```
Gouvia Marina → Plataria (24nm ~ 3.5hrs)
```
> When navigating to Platarias you will pass through a natural valley hoping to discover the harbour at the end as it can be difficult to spot.  Don’t be fooled by this sleepy village that at first glance can appear to be deserted and which still respects the traditional siesta hours.  Come early evening it turns into a vi-brant village harbour.

### Wednesday
```
Paxos -> Sivota Mourtos (14nm ~ 2hrs)
```
> Referred to as Sivota Mourtos because of the huge uninhabited island (Sivota) that dominates the entrance to the vibrant town harbour called Mourtos.  The locals com-bine these two names so as not to confuse it with another Sivota located further south.  There are some beautiful anchorages around this area as well as the harbour wall of Mourtos.  Enjoy a meal at one of the restaurants in Mourtos or stock up on provision at the mini-market prior to returning to your yacht.  However you choose to spend your evening make sure you enjoy a drink at Mourtos’famous cocktail bar.
